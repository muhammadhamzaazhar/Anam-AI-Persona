# Real-Time Emotive Personas for Human-Like Interactions

A demo application that integrates Anam AI‚Äôs real-time digital personas to create engaging, human-like conversational experiences. The showcased persona acts as a digital clone: whatever you type or say through your microphone is echoed back word-for-word in natural speech and synchronized facial animation, demonstrating Anam‚Äôs sub-second latency and photorealistic expression technology.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time AI Persona Conversations: Interactive video chat with AI personas
- Text & Speech input: Interact via the chat box microphone to speak; both inputs are transcribed and replayed by the avatar.
- Chat History: Track conversation flow between user and AI

## üß† Enable Autonomous Conversation with a Custom LLM

By default, the demo persona simply echoes back the user‚Äôs words (word-for-word).  
If you‚Äôd like to make your AI persona **respond autonomously**, you can modify the `systemPrompt` and use a custom `llmId`.

Below is an example of a `personaConfig` that acts as a conversational agent.

> **Note:** `personaConfig` is defined in `server.js`.

You can also customize the avatar and voice:
